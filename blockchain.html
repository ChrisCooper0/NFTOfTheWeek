        <h2 class="font-medium text-sm text-indigo-400 mb-4 uppercase tracking-wide">By Chris Cooper</h2>
        <p class="mt-6 mb-6">Blockchain is a protocol that creates a decentralised network of computers working
            together, without needing to trust each other.
            <br><br>
            Calling it a distributed ledger or database far undersells
            its capabilities; it has the potential to be a distributed supercomputer, transferring power from the few to
            the many. The computers on the network, or nodes, pool their resources to accomplish some task, depending on
            the particular blockchain.
            <br><br>
            For the Bitcoin blockchain, this simply means storing and transferring value;
            this is the most basic use case.
            <br><br>
            For Ethereum and other fully programmable (Turing complete) blockchains,
            the nodes work together to execute code, known as smart contracts. This enables programs that would be too
            resource intensive for any single node to run on its own.
            <br><br>

            What makes blockchain revolutionary compared to other decentralised networks like the internet, is that you
            can trust that millions of strangers (other nodes) are all there to help the network, as opposed to stealing
            from it or otherwise sabotaging.
            <br><br>
            There is no central authority enforcing any rules or policing the nodes;
            the protocol does all this automatically. It accomplishes this through economic incentive and computational
            democracy. Every node on the network uses whatever computational resources at its disposal to verify new
            transactions and smart contracts as they are added to the chain; this is the process of mining.
            <br><br>

            You can
            think of the miners as replacing the central servers a company like Visa or Mastercard uses to process
            transactions. Miners are compensated for their work (electricity) with whatever the native cryptocurrency of
            their blockchain is (Bitcoins, Ethers, etc.). If they verify incorrect transactions, they lose out on this
            reward, incentivising them to be honest. How do they know what the truth is? The truth is simply what the
            majority of other nodes agree on.
            <br><br>

            Mining is computationally expensive to secure this democratic system. Bad actors can’t simply connect to the
            network and rewrite history in their favor (stuff the ballot box). To rewrite the history of the chain, an
            attacker would have to start at the block they wanted to edit, then rewrite every single block since then,
            each requiring large amounts of processing power.
            <br><br> They would then need to get other nodes, who are
            incentivised to be honest, to agree with their version of history. This is essentially impossible. In fact,
            the only way they could do this would be to have the majority of nodes under their direct control, something
            that hasn’t happened yet. This is why people say the blockchain is “unhackable”, and why you don’t need to
            trust any other users to trust in the blockchain.
            <br><br>

            So you can trust the system, who cares? What does this system actually do?
            <br><br>
            Through smart contracts, you can
            automate almost any transaction without some central authority (bank) taking a cut, or limiting your
            options. Whether it’s selling solar power from your roof to your neighbor, or sending money to your family
            in another country, blockchain means the community makes the rules, not some corporation.
